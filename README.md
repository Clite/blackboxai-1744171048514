# Course Dashboard

## Project Overview
The Course Dashboard is a web application designed to provide users with a seamless platform to manage and view courses. Users can be categorized as students, instructors, or admins, each with tailored access to features such as viewing available courses, creating new courses, and more. This application leverages modern web technologies for a responsive design and efficient user experience.

## Installation
To set up the Course Dashboard on your local environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repository-url.git
   cd course-dashboard
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):
   Ensure you have PHP installed on your local machine. If using Composer for dependency management (if applicable), run the following command:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Database setup**:
   - Create a database and import the necessary schema (if any SQL files are provided).
   - Update the `config.php` file with your database credentials.

4. **Start the server**:
   If you are using PHP's built-in server, run:
   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```
   Access the application at `http://localhost:8000/dashboard.php` to view the dashboard.

## Usage
After setting up the dashboard, users can log in through the `/auth/login.php` page. Depending on their role (student, instructor, or admin), users can access different functionalities. 

- **Students**: View available courses.
- **Instructors**: View their courses and create new ones.
- **Admins**: Manage all courses and users.

## Features
- Multi-user roles with tailored experiences:
  - Students can browse available courses.
  - Instructors can create and manage their own courses.
  - Admins can oversee all courses and users.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS for a modern user interface.
- Dynamic content loading based on user roles.

## Dependencies
The following main dependencies are used in the project:

- Tailwind CSS: For styling the interface. It is linked from a CDN.
- Font Awesome: For icons throughout the application (also linked from a CDN).

There are no specific dependencies listed in a `package.json` file, as the project seems to be primarily PHP-based without a frontend JS framework.

## Project Structure
The project directory has the following structure:

```

For further customization and development, consider enhancing features such as user registration, course feedback, and comprehensive user management.
